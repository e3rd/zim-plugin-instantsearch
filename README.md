# Instant Search Plugin for Zim Wiki
Search as you type in Zim, in similar manner to OneNote Ctrl+E.

When you hit Ctrl+E, small window opens, you can type in. As you type third letter, every page that matches your search is listed. You can walk through by UP/DOWN arrow, hit Enter to stay on the page, or Esc to cancel.
Much quicker than current Zim search.


### Working with & Feedback
Known to work on:

* Ubuntu 17.04 Zim 0.67+
* Ubuntu 15.10 Zim 0.65+
* Win 7 Zim 0.63+
* Debian 8.9 Zim 0.62-3, 0.65-4, 0.67-1

I'd be glad to hear from you if it's working either here in the issues or in the original bug https://bugs.launchpad.net/zim/+bug/1409626 .

### Installation
Same as for the other plugins.
* Put the instantsearch.py into the plugins folder
  * something like %appdata%\zim\data\zim\plugins in Win, or /~/.local/share/zim/plugins/ in Linux
* You enable the plugin in Zim/Edit/Preferences/Plugins/ check mark Instant search.
* Type Ctrl+E and see if it's working, or report it here

### Demonstration on YouTube
Wanna see how it looks in action? In this example, I just search for the string "linux f" twice.
