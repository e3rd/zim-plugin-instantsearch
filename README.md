# Instant Search Plugin for Zim Wiki
Search as you type in Zim, in similar manner to OneNote Ctrl+E.

When you hit Ctrl+E, small window opens, you can type in. As you type third letter, every page that matches your search is listed. You can walk through by UP/DOWN arrow, hit Enter to stay on the page, or Esc to cancel.
Much quicker than current Zim search.


### Working with & Feedback
Known to work on Ubuntu 17.04 Zim 0.67+, Ubuntu 15.10 Zim 0.65+, Win 7 Zim 0.63+.  
(For **earlier version than Zim 0.66-**, open the plugin configuration window for Instant Search and enable the option for using Zim version earlier than 0.66-, or use an old Instant Search commit from Mar 17 instead of the current version.)
I'd be glad to hear from you if it's working either here in the issues or in the original bug https://bugs.launchpad.net/zim/+bug/1409626 .

### Installation
Same as for the other plugins.
* Put the instantsearch.py into the plugins folder
  * something like %appdata%\zim\data\zim\plugins in Win, or /~/.local/share/zim/plugins/ in Linux
* You enable the plugin in Zim/Edit/Preferences/Plugins/ check mark Instant search.
* Type Ctrl+E and see if it's working, or report it here

### Demonstration on YouTube
Wanna see how it looks in action? In this example, I just search for the string "linux f" twice.
